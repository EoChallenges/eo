* **_State of Washington v. Trump et al._** On Appeal to Ninth Circuit 17-35105 
    + [Ninth Circuit Site][14]
    + [Docket #92][17] below:
```
The United States has represented to the Court that the President 
intends to issue a new Executive Order and has urged the Court to hold

* **_State of Washington v. Trump et al._** 2:17-cv-00141-JLR (D. Wash.) :
    + **Status**: Appealed by Govt 17-35105
    + TRO issued asserting nationwide restraint on Executive Order
    + 2017-02-03 TRO [(PDF Linked here)](../wdwa/2017-02-03_WDWA_TRO.pdf)
    + 2017-02-14 no futher proceedings on the TRO (Dckt #78)
```
ORDER by Judge James L. Robart. The court concludes that the Ninth 
Circuit has construed the court's TRO (Dkt. # 52 ) as an appealable 
preliminary injunction and that further briefing or the submission 
of evidence concerning a preliminary injunction would not be 
appropriate in this court during the pendency of Defendants' appeal. 
However, the court ORDERS the parties to continue with other aspects 
of this litigation  . . .. If issues or motions subsequently arise 
that either party believes are inextricably bound up with the injunctive 
order, the court will address those motions or issues on a case-by-case 
basis in accordance with the case law set forth above. Finally, the court 
VACATES the briefing schedule set forth in its February 7, 2017, 
order (Dkt. # 57 )
